  abstract = {As the generation and use of big data becomes more prevalent in youth work, young people grow up in a world that ``knows'' more about their lives than ever before. Beyond school attendance and grades, these systems know about outof-school program participation, social service resources, therapeutic interventions, and more. Though data historically was used to understand and improve program achievements, communicate with funders, and track participants, it is increasingly used to suggest and even perform interventions in young peoples' lives. Young people are rarely asked how they feel about these systems. This study, presented as a counter-narrative from their perspective, differentiates the big data collected and analyzed about them from the ``big data'' - or stuff that they feel really matters about who they are and the challenges they face. It concludes by offering four questions to help youth-serving organizations consider the ways they generate and use data, in light of the many issues young people raise about new big data trends.},

  abstract = {Community-level data systems, often called collective impact, increasingly define the landscape of human service data creation. Collective impact strategies develop shared performance measurement metrics across numerous human service organizations (HSOs) in a geographic region to move the needle on specific social problems. Such systems encourage funders to support the development of client tracking and data sharing infrastructure, meaning more HSOs have more information about any given client. However, while many HSOs are using more data than ever, questions remain: how is this data being read, understood, and utilized in HSOs? What differences can we discern in organizational operation and service provision? This study builds on three years of participant observation as program evaluators in youth-serving organizations (a subtype of HSOs) around the world. It also included a national study of youthserving organizations with a strong focus on data use. Finally, it includes interviews with program staff in youth-serving organizations and focus group data with young people. Situating this data between the literature on performance measurement in HSOs and critical data studies, we surface emerging tensions in the ways youth-serving organizations are creating and using data, drawing to the fore salient questions for those invested in supporting the just use of data and technology for our communities.},

Emerging from a five-year study across eight sites in across the globe, the Learning Partner approach begins with two ideas. First, evaluation is a process of learning and adaptation. Second, evaluation flourishes through partnerships. We begin by joining this model to developments in evaluations over the last 50 years, illustrating its connection to evaluation theory as well as its extension beyond current evaluation practice in international development. We share how this approach shapes the evaluation process through collaborative storytelling and describe both the approach and the practice. While not yet a decolonial evaluation approach, we advocate that it gestures towards decoloniality and opens the question: how can we begin to decolonize the evaluation process?},
